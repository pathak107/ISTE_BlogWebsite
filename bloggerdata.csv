1,"The Witcher Netflix Series is Still the Top Show in the World","Before The Witcher premiered, fans of the franchise had doubts that the show would do the material justice. A lot of the uncertainty pointed at Geralt's actor, Henry Cavil, for being "too pretty" for the role, and the show's director, Lauren Hissrich, for some of the choices she made during the show's production.

Fast forward two months after the show's premiere, however, and it's the most in-demand and streamed series around the world. Its success has even bolstered the sales of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and The Witcher books written by Andrzej Sapkowski.

This information comes from the data firm Parrot Analytics. The company measured The Witcher's success through something called "demand expressions": a TV measurement accepted around the globe that takes into account the viewership, desire, and engagement of a show weighted by importance. Parrot Analytics then reported the information to Business Insider.

According to the data, despite the fact that The Witcher's viewership has declined in the US, mainly due to the vast majority having already binged it several times since it's release, the show is still the most in-demand television series across all platforms around the world. It's managed to hold that position for the last 30 days, from January 14 to February 12, after beating out The Madolorian for the number 1 spot over seven weeks ago. In the US, specifically, though, The Witcher takes third place in favor of Stranger Things (second place) and The Mandalorian (first place).",1585857133150-1witcher.jpg,"2020-04-02 19:52:13","Shubham Pathak","I am a web developer and I made this blog website.

2,"PlayStation Store is Not Selling Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered in Russia","With its release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered has injected fans with a nostalgia for its classic gameplay. However, the fact that the fan-favorite multiplayer will not be remastered is not currently the most contentious issue. According to Activision, Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered will not be released for the PlayStation in Russia.

While the publisher did not give an explicit reason for this decision, it is more than likely because of the No Russian mission, which centered around a mass shooting perpetrated by Russian terrorists and the player. The content subsequently caused a massive debate, garnered widespread criticism, and originally led to a disclaimer and an option to skip the mission being added. Fans were surprised to see that the Modern Warfare 2 remaster was keeping it in the campaign without any changes.


While the variety of responses lined up with other trending Twitter replies, noting that the decision was understandable due to the mission's divisive nature, Russian fans in the replies actually criticized Sony's rejection of the game and stated that they would likely purchase the game on one of the alternative platforms. The negative reaction might also be due to the game's current timed exclusivity for the PlayStation, which might force Russian fans to wait even longer to get their hands on the game.

Some might argue that the remaster was right to keep the mission to maintain the edge and grit in Modern Warfare 2's original campaign, and accuse Sony Interactive Entertainment Russia of unjust censorship. However, the mission's objectives and gameplay verges on gratuitous. While artistic integrity is important, the violence and disturbing nature of the No Russian mission makes Sony's final rejection understandable. Despite the understandable disappointment Russian fans might feel, they won't have to wait long for the timed exclusivity to end.",1585857329823-1callofduty.jpg,"2020-04-02 19:55:29","Sherlock Holmes","I am a detective and i solve the world's most difficult cases with my companion john watson",1
3,"10 Hidden Secrets Many Still Havenâ€™t Found In Animal Crossing: New Horizons","Animal Crossing fans both old and new have been catching bugs, growing trees, and decorating their homes since Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out on the 20th. Unless you are a time-traveling sort of player, then you are just getting settled with filling up your museum, gathering villagers, and grooming your island into the perfect home.

Cutting down trees has always been part of the game, but now you can actually re-locate them! All you need to do is eat a lot of fruit (up to 10) and they power you up to do what would be impossible otherwise.

If you eat a lot of fruit and use a shovel on a full-grown tree, you will un-root it and put it in your pocket! So you don't have to plant the fruit anymore, you can just relocate entire trees!

While there are Nook Mile achievements you can see and unlock with tools, there are some that you will never see unless you already perform the action. This includes getting bitten my tarantulas or accidentally losing a balloon present in a river, lake, or ocean.

Rocks are more than just a Bell resource in New Horizons. With the crafting mechanics, you can harvest rocks for clay, iron, and more. If you don't like a rocks' placement on your island, the gave has given you a way to break it!

Just eat a lot of fruit. If you are powered up by fruit and use the ax or shovel on the rock, it will shatter and be destroyed. You also don't have to worry about where you will get resources from, as a new rock will appear on your island in a couple of days.",1585857513028-1Destroy.jpg,"2020-04-02 19:58:33","Some random Name","Some random facts about the author as i need to fill the space of about author.

4,"New Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Super DLC Screenshots Reveal Surprising Character","If everything goes according to plan, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot players will get their first taste of DLC with "A New Awakening (Part I: Whis' Training)" before the end of Spring 2020. There have been no hints as to its release date, though the narrow window means predicting DBZ: Kakarot's DLC release date isn't impossible, but there should be a formal reveal soon. After all, more and more screenshots are being revealed for the upcoming DLC.

The latest include a set of Saikyo Jump magazine scans revealing in-game screenshots. For the most part, these are to be expected, showing Goku and Beerus, connecting Whis to Super Saiyan God Goku and Super Saiyan God Vegeta, and highlighting some of Beerus' moves. However, upon close inspection of the third image, a new character related to the DBZ: Kakarot DLC can be found: the Oracle Fish.

To the uninitiated, the Oracle Fish is a minor character found just in a few-spin off games, the Gods of the Universe Z Saga, and at rare moments in Dragon Ball Super. She is the one who told Beerus that he would meet with a worthy challenger in the Super Saiyan God and appears to love food just as much as Beerus and Whis. Other than sticking with her predictions, the Oracle Fish's role in the anime and manga is relatively small, but it appears she has some functionality int he DLC.",1585857636923-1dgballz.jpg,"2020-04-02 20:00:36","JOSHUA DUCKWORTH","When Joshua Duckworth received Pokemon Yellow for Christmas at 5-years-old, his fate as a gamer was set.

5,"Red Dead Redemption 2: What Happened to Sadie Adler and Charles Smith?","In the original Red Dead Redemption, players take control of John Marston as he is forced to hunt down his former gang members from his Dutch Van der Linde days. So it was surprising when Red Dead Redemption 2 turned out to be a prequel, featured characters that weren't in the main game, and yet somehow they seem to have been spared by the Pinkertons/BOI and the fate met by so many main characters. Obviously, the worst offender for this is Arthur Morgan.

It's clear that Morgan was an important character to John, Abigail, and Jack Marston, so it's a bit of a glaring oversight that he's never mentioned in the first game. What this makes clear is that Arthur Morgan didn't originally exist in the Red Dead Redemption, being created solely for Red Dead Redemption 2. Nonetheless, this can be forgiven and chalked up to video game logic, as the character plays his role in the grand scheme of things perfectly. What isn't so clear is the fate of Sadie Adler and Charles Smith, two character additions which were well met but don't enjoy the same ride into the sunset as Arthur Morgan

Sadie Adler isn't just one of the strongest female video game characters of 2018, but one of the strongest female characters Rockstar Games has ever made. She's a rancher-turned-outlaw who takes revenge on the O'Driscolls for the death of her husband, growing close to Arthur Morgan and John Marston both throughout the events of the game, yet despite arguably being one of the toughest, less "redeemed" characters in Red Dead Redemption, that's never really reflected in the game universe.

For some reason, Adler is never an official member of the Van der Linde gang, at least not in the eyes of the law. Every mention of the game foregoes her name, which is increasingly surprising given that she's responsible for their survival during the Guarma chapter of Red Dead Redemption 2. Furthermore, Charles Smith is named as a member on the run, so it's truly unclear as to why this may be. It could be because she is a female, so more attention was paid to Dutch, Arthur, and the like, but whatever the case, it worked to her advantage.

Sadie Adler's responsible, at least partially, for a ton of crimes, including but not limited to, breaking Marston out of Sisika Penitentiary, publicly mudering men, fighting Pinkertons, helping the Wapiti people, and robbing the US army payroll train. Yet somehow, she is able to become a bounty hunter, working closely with local law enforcement by the end of Red Dead Redemption 2, thereby contradicting a lot of the outlaw vs. civilization themes found throughout the games.

Many critics will note that Sadie Adler, unlike many core characters, doesn't have a redemption arc and never finds herself in a good place, yet that's not necessarily accurate. Adler never turns from her more serious, more brutal, and law-stretching ways, but she climbed out of her darkest pit. She's one of few characters who presumably make it out of this alive; with the very nature of the franchise suggesting Jack Marston will eventually meet the same fate as his father and Arthur Morgan, that's more than noteworthy (and a good place) for a Red Dead Redemption 2 character.",1585857773609-1reddead.jpg,"2020-04-02 20:02:53","JOSHUA DUCKWORTH","When Joshua Duckworth received Pokemon Yellow for Christmas at 5-years-old, his fate as a gamer was set.

6,"How Resident Evil 3 Remake Changed Jill Valentine","Throughout Resident Evil's 24-year history, the franchise has produced a cast of amazing characters that have since become beloved icons in the video game industry. Of course, while every Resident Evil fan will have their own favorite character, it is without a doubt that, despite a long absence, Jill Valentine remains to be one of the most popular Resident Evil characters of all time. In just a week from today, Jill Valentine is making a return with the release of the highly-anticipated remake of Resident Evil 3, which chronicles her desperate escape from Raccoon City and the relentless pursuit of Nemesis.

Similar to the 2019 remake of its predecessor, Resident Evil 3 remake is set to bring a lot of new things to the reimagining of the 1999 game. Ever since the announcement of Resident Evil 3 back in December of last year, Capcom has been generous enough to give fans a peek at what to expect in the upcoming game, which includes a major overhaul of the game's protagonist, Jill Valentine. But with physical redesigns aside, is Capcom's portrayal of Jill Valentine in the remake still the same with the original?

To those who are not so well-versed in Resident Evil's long history, Jill Valentine is one of the first playable characters in Resident Evil, and many claim that she is also the first female playable character in a survival-horror game. When Capcom first introduced Jill, she is described as a capable police officer, whose strengths include her compassionate nature, a strong sense of justice, and her ability to work well under extreme pressure. It is fairly difficult to go in-depth on Jill's personality during the first Resident Evil game, since she barely had any, given that Capcom's priority at this point in Resident Evil's history was to introduce strong survival-horror gameplay.

Given this, the personalities of both playable characters weren't as fleshed-out, especially when compared to modern games. However, based on dialogue alone, Jill did not really embody the traits of a traditional video game heroine, and while she is capable enough to handle the situation she's in, she lacked the flair and personality that is common in today's video game protagonist. But in retrospect, even if it wasn't intentional, Capcom's portrayal of Jill in the first Resident Evil game does make sense, given that this game served as her origin story. Prior to the mansion incident, Jill has no experience in dealing with bioweapons, so it wouldn't really make sense to portray her as a badass bioweapon killing machine when this is the first time that she even knew bioweapons existed.",1585857883824-1jill-valentine-feature.jpg,"2020-04-02 20:04:43","RAMON HARA","Ramon is a writer for GameRant and an avid gamer since the era of the original PlayStation.
